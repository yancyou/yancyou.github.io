Welcome to my homepage. I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in **[Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/)** (**[UW-Madison, CDIS](https://cdis.wisc.edu/)**, CS#13). PMy research/internship experience covers Peking University SEKE Lab (advised by Prof. [Jin Zhi](https://example.com/jinzhi)) and Prof. [Li Ge](https://example.com/lige)), Tsinghua University CoAI Lab (advised by Prof. [Zhang ByteDance](https://example.com/zhangbytedance), Zhipu, Zen-AI, and now in DeepLearning Group (advised by Prof. [Sharon Li](https://example.com/sharonli)). I am very grateful to the above institutions, mentors and collaborators.

I have experience in **NLP and computer systems**(both architecture and high performance machine learning systems), along with extensive industry research internship experience. This includes:

* Participating in the pretraining of the **Yi-Lightning model** at [01.AI](https://01.ai/).
* Contributing to ML Infra of the pretraining of the foundation model at ModelBest (with TsinghuaNLP).
* Participating in the finetuning of the CodeLLM [Raccoon](https://raccoon.sensetime.com/code) (Copilot-like) at SenseTime (with CUHK MMLab).

#### Research Interests

My current passion revolves around building **EFFICIENT** system solutions to AGI (**Now I am interested in O1-like models ML Infra**), this includes:

1. **Machine Learning System** 
    * Training: Design more effective training system and algorithms, example includes [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain).
    * Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT): Improve LoRA-like architecture and low bit model compression. example includes [IAPT](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.771.pdf). 
    * Long context inference: example includes [Cross Layer Attention](https://github.com/JerryYin777/Cross-Layer-Attention).
2. **LLM & LLM applications** 
    * CodeLLM
    * Foundation LLM (Yi-lightning)
    * RAG (GraphRAG): Examples includes [PaperHelper](https://github.com/JerryYin777/PaperHelper).

#### Misc

* Before transferring to the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), I studied at Nanchang University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence in a top-tier class with a School Academic Special Scholarship. I was the leader of Nanchang University Supercomputer Cluster Team ([NCUSCC](https://ncuscc.github.io/)) Leader, with experience of ASC22 and SC23(IndySCC). 

* I am passionate about open source and firmly believe in its potential to disseminate knowledge widely, leverage technology to lead innovation to the world and contribute to the advancement of human society. I am proud to have garnered over **4k stars** and acquired over **370 followers** on [GitHub](https://github.com/yancyou). I occasionally share my explorations in the machine learning system and LLM field on [知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/people/ycr222/posts) in Mandarin and [X](https://x.com/OuYoungXuan) in English.

* I love league of legends and valorant games!
