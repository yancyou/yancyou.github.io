Welcome to my homepage. I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in **[<span style="color:#0400ff">Computer Science</span>](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/)** (**[<span style="color:#0400ff">UW-Madison, CDIS</span>](https://cdis.wisc.edu/)**, CS#13). My research/internship experience covers [<span style="color:#0400ff">Shanghai Jiao Tong University Epic Lab</span>](https://github.com/SJTU-EPIC-Lab) (advised by Prof. [<span style="color:#0400ff">Linfeng Zhang</span>](http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/) and work with my mentor [<span style="color:#0400ff">Shaobo Wang</span>](https://gszfwsb.github.io/)). University College London (work with Dr. [<span style="color:#0400ff">Yujian Gan</span>](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/100730-yujian-gan)). I'm also a machine learning research assistant in [<span style="color:#0400ff">UW-Madison Marler Lab</span>](https://marlerlab.psych.wisc.edu/)(advised by Prof. [<span style="color:#0400ff">Catherine Marler</span>](https://marlerlab.psych.wisc.edu/staff/marler-catherine/)). I am very grateful to the above institutions, mentors and collaborators.

#### Research Interests

My current passion revolves around building AI systems that not only perceive and generate across modalities, but also reason, act, and learn from the world in a data-driven, tool-empowered fashion—advancing us toward truly intelligent, context-aware agents. Which includes:

1. **Multimodal LLMs**  

    Build scalable transformer architectures that integrate visual, textual, and auditory modalities—leveraging modality-specific encoders and joint training objectives—to enable unified understanding and generation across diverse sensory inputs.

2. **Agent Tool Use**  

    Design intelligent agent frameworks where LLMs plan and orchestrate external API calls, database queries, and code execution—incorporating dynamic tool selection, stateful memory, and error-handling—to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

3. **Multimodal Reasoning**  

    Develop cross-modal reasoning frameworks that align and fuse heterogeneous signals—using hierarchical attention, graph-based representations, and consistency objectives—to enable agents to perform robust inference and decision-making across visual, textual, and auditory data streams.

4. **Data-Centric AI**  

    Build end-to-end pipelines for curating, validating, and augmenting datasets—measuring coverage, balance, and consistency—to ensure every model component is trained on high-quality, representative examples.

#### Misc

* Before transferring to the [<span style="color:#0400ff">University of Minnesota</span>](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), I studied at Nanchang University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence in a top-tier class with a School Academic Special Scholarship. I was the leader of Nanchang University Supercomputer Cluster Team ([<span style="color:#0400ff">NCUSCC</span>](https://ncuscc.github.io/)) Leader, with experience of ASC22 and SC23(IndySCC). 

* I am passionate about open source and firmly believe in its potential to disseminate knowledge widely, leverage technology to lead innovation to the world and contribute to the advancement of human society. I am proud to have garnered over **4k stars** and acquired over **370 followers** on [<span style="color:#0400ff">GitHub</span>](https://github.com/yancyou). I occasionally share my explorations in the machine learning system and LLM field on [<span style="color:#0400ff">知乎</span>](https://www.zhihu.com/people/ycr222/posts) in Mandarin and [<span style="color:#0400ff">X</span>](https://x.com/OuYoungXuan) in English.

* I love league of legends and valorant games!
